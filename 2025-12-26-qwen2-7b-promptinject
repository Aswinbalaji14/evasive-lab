# Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct Prompt Injection (Partial Run)
Date: 2025-12-26  
Tool: Garak v0.13.3 (HF Inference API)

Date,Model,Probe Category,NISTAML ID,Success Rate,Research Note
2024-12-17,Phi-3-mini-4k,promptinject,.015 / .018,57.51%,Initial baseline: RogueString vulnerability.
2024-12-26,Phi-3-mini-4k,Harmful Content,.033,71.95% (Hate)  20.16% (Violence),Safety Gap: Model is 3.5x more resistant to violence than hate.
2024-12-26,Phi-3-mini-4k,Instruction Drift,.041,51.95% (LongPrompt),Reliability Risk: Safety adherence degrades as context length increases.

Shows high variation — hate injection more effective than violence.
NISTAML.015 / .018
